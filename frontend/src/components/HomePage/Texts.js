                        One in twelve people live in extreme poverty. 
                        It’s a cycle that’s hard to break. 
                        But when women thrive the whole community benefits. 
                        That’s why we partner with women in extreme poverty. We invest in them and the structures they need to succeed. With training and mentoring, 
                        they build sustainable livelihoods and transform their futures.
